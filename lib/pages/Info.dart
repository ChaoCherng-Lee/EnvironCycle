The reason why plastic bags are not recyclable is that they tend to get caught in machinery at recycling facilities, causing work to stop and workers to get injured. If you must bag your recyclables, make sure you empty the recyclable items that are inside the bag into your curbside bin, rather than tossing in the entire bag.',

Excess food residue can attract critters and make it more expensive to recycle because of the resources needed to clean recyclables and to remove pests. For containers filled with sticky substances, such as honey, jelly, or peanut butter, take a few extra seconds to give them a scrub. For paper products such as pizza boxes, if it only has a few specks of grease, it can be recycled. So, try to get rid of any food remnants that might be left in the box.',

From there, you can make informed purchasing decisions in the future. After reducing, try reusing! ',
